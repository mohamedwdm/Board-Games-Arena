This C++ project is Board Game Arena, featuring four games: Classic Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3), 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, and a custom Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe.
 Players can choose between Player vs Player mode or challenge the computer, which makes moves using a random-move algorithm for unpredictable gameplay.
 The project is designed with a modular structure, making it scalable and maintainable, while the console-based interface ensures a clean and user-friendly experience.
 Robust input validation and error handling guarantee smooth gameplay, and the custom Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe adds a unique twist to traditional board games.
 This project showcases my expertise in C++ programming, algorithm design, and game logic implementation.
